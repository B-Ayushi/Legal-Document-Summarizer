       Legal Document Summarization and Analysis
=========================================

Overview:
-----------
This project extracts, summarizes, and analyzes legal documents, focusing on key legal terms and laws. 
It supports PDF and DOCX files, using NLP techniques to generate concise summaries and extract relevant legal references.

Features:
-----------
- Extract text from PDF and DOCX files and preprocess it to remove unnecessary characters.
- Identify key legal terms such as laws, acts, and articles.
- Summarize legal content using transformer models.
- Answer user questions based on extracted content.
- Save and download results as a text file.

Tech Stack:
------------
- Programming Language: Python
- Platform: Google Colab
- Libraries & Tools:
  - pdfplumber, python-docx, nltk – for text extraction and processing
  - transformers – for summarization and question-answering
  - KeyBERT – for keyword extraction
  - TextBlob – for text analysis

Installation:
--------------
-- Run the following command in your terminal:
pip install pdfplumber python-docx nltk transformers accelerate langchain keybert textblob PyMuPDF

Usage:
-------
1. Upload File
   - Upload a PDF or DOCX file in Google Colab.

2. Extract and Clean Text
   - The script extracts and processes text from the document.

3. Summarization
   - The document is split into smaller chunks and summarized using models like FLAN-T5 and DistilBART.

4. Legal Term Extraction
   - Regular expressions identify references to laws, acts, and articles.

5. Question Answering
   - Users can ask questions about the document, and the model provides relevant answers.

6. Save & Download Summary
   - The summarized text, along with key legal terms, is saved as a text file and downloaded.

Example Output:
-----------------
Summary:
---------
The document discusses key provisions related to environmental law, including...

Legal Acts:
------------
- Environmental Impact Assessment
- Forest Act, 2006
- Hazardous Waste Management Rules

Future Improvements:
---------------------
- Improve OCR handling for scanned PDFs.
- Enhance legal term recognition using AI models.
- Add support for more document formats.
